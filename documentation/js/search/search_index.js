BullMQ SMS Processor\n * \n * @description\n * Processes SMS notification jobs from the 'sms-queue'.\n * Handles two types of SMS notifications:\n * 1. Rich tourist notifications with travel time and location details\n * 2. Basic SMS notifications with simple text message\n * \n * Features:\n * - Automatic retry on failure (configured in queue)\n * - Status tracking (pending → sent/failed)\n * - Error logging with retry count\n * - Phone number validation\n * - Event hooks for completed/failed jobs\n * \n * @export\n * @class SmsProcessor\n * @extends {WorkerHost}\n */\n@Injectable()\n@Processor('sms-queue')\nexport class SmsProcessor extends WorkerHost {\n  private readonly logger = new Logger(SmsProcessor.name);\n\n  /**\n   * Creates an instance of SmsProcessor\n   * \n   * @param {Repository} notificationRepo - Notification repository for status updates\n   * @param {SmsProvider} smsProvider - SMS sending provider (Twilio)\n   */\n  constructor(\n    @InjectRepository(Notification)\n    private notificationRepo: Repository,\n    private smsProvider: SmsProvider,\n  ) {\n    super();\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Processes SMS notification job\n   * \n   * @description\n   * Main processing logic:\n   * 1.

(\\`.hbs\\` files): Handlebars templates for generating documentation pages\n- **Styles** (\\`.css\\` files): Stylesheets for customizing the appearance\n- **Scripts** (\\`.js\\` files): JavaScript files for additional functionality\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Extract this ZIP file to a directory on your system\n2. Use the \\`--templates\\` flag when running Compodoc to specify the path to your custom templates:\n\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   compodoc -p tsconfig.json --templates ./path/to/custom/templates/\n   \\`\\`\\`\n\n## Template Structure\n\n- \\`page.hbs\\` - Main page template\n- \\`partials/\\` - Directory containing partial templates\n- \\`styles/\\` - Directory containing CSS files\n- \\`js/\\` - Directory containing JavaScript files\n\n## Customization Tips\n\n1. **Templates**: Use Handlebars syntax to customize the HTML structure\n2. **Styles**: Modify CSS to change colors, fonts, layout, etc.\n3. **Scripts**: Add custom JavaScript functionality\n\n## Backup\n\nAlways keep a backup of your original templates before making changes.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more information about customizing Compodoc templates, visit:\nhttps://compodoc.app/guides/template-customization.html\n\nGenerated by Compodoc Template Playground\n`;\n  }\n\n  private downloadBlob(blob: Blob, filename:

comprehensive multi-channel notifications (Email, SMS, WhatsApp, Push) for sending personalized tourist place recommendations based on user location using Google Places API.\nKey Features\n\n🔐 JWT Authentication with refresh tokens\n🌍 Google Places API integration for nearby places\n📧 Multi-channel Notifications: Email (Resend), SMS (Twilio), WhatsApp (Twilio), Push (Firebase)\n📊 Queue Processing with BullMQ and Redis\n🗄️ PostgreSQL database with TypeORM\n📝 Swagger API Documentation\n🧪 Unit Testing with Jest\n🔄 Automatic retry system for failed notifications\n\nProject setup\nExample :$ npm installEnvironment Configuration\nCreate a .env file in the root directory:\nExample :#

http://localhost:8080\n\nExample :\n## Notification Flow\n\n1. User requests place recommendation (`POST /notifications/send`)\n2. System searches nearby place with Google Places API\n3. Creates notification in DB with `pending` status\n4. Enqueues job in BullMQ by selected channel(s)\n5. Worker processes job and sends notification\n6. Updates status to `sent` or `failed`\n7. Retries automatically on failure (max 3 attempts)\n\n## Main API Endpoints\n\n### AuthenticationPOST /auth/register          # User registration\nPOST /auth/login            # User login\nPOST /auth/refresh          # Refresh token\nGET  /auth/profile          # User profile\nExample :\n### NotificationsPOST /notifications/send                    # Send notification\nGET  /notifications/user/:userId           # User history\nGET  /notifications/user/:userId/stats     # User statistics\nExample :\n### PlacesGET /places/nearby?lat=4.7110&lng=-74.0721&type=restaurant\nExample :\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Framework**: NestJS 10, TypeORM, PostgreSQL\n- **Queue**: BullMQ, Redis\n- **Auth**: Passport JWT\n- **Docs**: Swagger, Compodoc\n- **Testing**: Jest\n- **Notifications**: Twilio, Resend, Firebase\n- **APIs**: Google Places API\n\n## Deployment\n\nWhen you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible.
